   c. Click on `Load unpacked extension`

   d. Select the `build` folder.

6. Happy hacking.

## ðŸ˜Ž Webpack auto-reload and HRM

To make your workflow much more efficient this boilerplate uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm start`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file in your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm run start
```

>**Tips**: Content Scripts is not supported to HRM in manifest version 3.

## ðŸ“¦ Packing

After the development of this extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be installed and published to the Chrome Web Store.
